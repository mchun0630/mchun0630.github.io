<ol>
<li><p>First, one must take their pdb file (taken from pdb.org) and convert it into a psf file. This is done by hitting <img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2jb7969.png" alt=""> in the VMD main window, then <img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/fnv5g9.png" alt="">, and finally <img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/1zezbwl.png" alt="">. You will this on your screen:<br><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/28iuh38.png" alt="">
*For this example, we'll use the pdb protein 1JLB.</p></li>
<li><p>Molecule simply names the molecule you want to make into a psf file. <img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2zeauqc.png" alt=""> is the name of your soon-to-be psf file; change it if you wish. Then hit <img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/w7eno9.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>For the next section, keep automatic settings and hit <img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2dmf53n.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>For the next section as well, keep automatic settings and hit <img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2pzcz0z.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>When <img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/25jyq82.png" alt=""> pops up, click "ok"</p></li>
<li><p>If, perhaps an error window pops up:<br><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/xcpwew.png" alt=""><br>
simply click <img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/qsr512.png" alt=""> and the error messages will clear. However this may jeopardize the quality of the mutated protein. </p></li>
<li><p>Click <img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2433loy.png" alt="">, and then you will have the psf file saved in your files. </p></li>
<li><p>Now we can go on to really mutating our residue. Hit <img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2jb7969.png" alt=""> in the VMD main window, then <img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/fnv5g9.png" alt="">, and finally<img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/wgyycl.png" alt="">. Then, the following window will open:<br><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/v4ov9i.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Upload the psf and pdb files of your protein. For the field marked MUTATED, retype the name you wish your mutated file to be called.<br><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/nx2r01.png" alt=""> refers to the original residue your target residue was<br><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/j0emwk.png" alt=""> is the residue number<br><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/24czm07.png" alt=""> is the amino acid of your desired mutation.<br>
An example of the procedure, is if you wanted to change a wild type HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase Tyrosin to Cysteine, then <img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/nx2r01.png" alt=""> would be TYR, <img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/j0emwk.png" alt=""> would be 181, and <img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/24czm07.png" alt=""> would be CYS<br>
You do not have to check the <img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/2u9na7p.png" alt=""> in order to mutate your residue.  </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, click <img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/11gu4ip.png" alt=""><br>
The mutated protein will now appear in your VMD window </p></li>

<p><a href="http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_1.9.0/">Use the online pdb2pqr website to run pdb2pqr</a> (changes file from pdb to the pqr format, this adds missing hydrogens, adds some missing heavy atoms, and optimizes the protein structure among other things)</p>

<p>First, go to the PDB2PQR website above. You should already have a selected protein form pdb.org in mind.
<em>(My example will be using the protein 2HNY)</em></p>

<p>Since I want my file to be compatible with VMD, for the both settings named "Pick a forcefield to use:" and "Pick an output naming scheme to use", choose the option CHARMM (PARSE works as well). </p>

<ul>
<li><p>To run with apbs, you need to change the setting in pdb2pqr to<br><em>Insert white spaces between atom name and residue name, between x and y, and between y and z</em></p></li>
<li><p>With PDB2PQR, unfortunately the program deletes any stray ligands that are in the molecule, which means to mutate accordingly a MOL2 file must be taken (which most are available at the ZINC database website). </p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>After running PDB2PQR from the website, click on the file under "Input Files" labeled something like "14084693082.pdb" (the number will be different but it will have a .pdb ending). This should start a download<br><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/30m65gk.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>*(It is useful to rename the file to 1FAS.pdb because it gets confusing when you have many different strings of numbers for different proteins)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>If the link didn't download, right click on this link and click "Save link as..." and save the file where you want to be able to find it.<br><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/2vlof7t.jpg" alt=""><br><strong>*(You should rename this file too)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Now you should download the same numbered file under "Output files" (mine is called 1408469302.pqr). This time you cannot click on it (as it will just bring up the a webpage with all the information in the file. You must right click and "Save link as..." this time.

<p>*DISCLAIMER: THIS IS FOR WINDOWS USERS ONLY (?)</p>

<p>In order to run APBS using command line, you will need to first download the APBS binary from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apbs/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/apbs/</a> as well as download the newest python version 2 release (<a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/">https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/</a>  as of 8/8/2014). </p>

<p>Why use the command line? It gives the user much more power over executable functions, immediately unzips the file, and is quite simple to use. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, in order to run APBS at all, you need to make a directory connecting APBS to the command line. 
To do so, go to the start menu, and right click on 'computer' The following should open:<br><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/qyy24i.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Click on properties, and the following should open:<br><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/raro1z.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Click on 'Advanced System Settings' ; the computer will ask you if you want to change settings. Click yes, and then the system properties window will open.<br><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/2ed7h8m.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Click 
<img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/4k9nci.png" alt="">, and another window will pop up.<br><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/i5bsdd.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>This is where you'll write your path. Click on the 
<img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/3167m0l.png" alt=""> to create a new path.  </p></li>
<li><p>TO make the directory, simply copy and paste<br><strong>C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\Util\pdb2pqr-windows-bin-1.9.0;C:\apbs\bin</strong><br>
and click ok. </p></li>
</ol><p>You can now run APBS!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, before running APBS through the command line, you must make sure your desired protein files are in the same folder as the apbs command prompt. If APBS downloaded correctly, it should be in your C drive (<img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/k2ih3r.png" alt="">) when you open "computer" from your start menu. </p></li>
<li><p>Click on the APBS folder, and in the APBS folder make a new folder for all your proteins; please label the folder accordingly, and remember the name of the folder. </p></li>
<li><p>It is important to remember, that when putting protein files in the folder, you need to put both the PQR as well as the corresponding IN file. PQR and IN files can both be obtained from the PDB2PQR webserver.<br>
(A PQR file is the information about the protein, whereas the IN file is a command file that tells APBS how to calculate the electrostatic fields. The In file is unique to one PQR file (as it specifies its commands to only one PQR file) and also holds other information such as dimensions and calculation specifications. Both files are needed to run APBS)<br><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/1tlwgo.png" alt=""><em>An example of the pdb2pqr webserver and the pqr and in files</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now that the folders are set up, you can open the command line. To open up the start menu, type in cmd.exe and open the command prompt; this is the command line execution for APBS.
The command prompt should look something similar to this:<br><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/otf7ut.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Of course, our PQR and IN files are not in this location, so we'll have to go back to our C:\ drive, then to our APBS Folder, then to our designated protein folder. To do so, in the command prompt hit "space", cd, "space", .., then enter. Your command prompt should look like the following:<br><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/mc5079.png" alt=""><br>
As you can see, this makes our prompt go up one directory. To go to the C:\ drive, type in the same command, and hit "enter"<br><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2h4hw8h.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Now, type "space", "cd", "space", "apbs" and hit "enter". You are now in your APBS folder. To get to your folder of proteins, type in "cd", "space", then type in the first letter of your folder name and hit "tab" until your folder name pops up. Then hit "enter"<br>
(<em>What the tab key does is find all files that start with the letters you have typed, for example, if you typed "i", then tab, the command prompt would go down, alphabetically, all your files in the folder that start with "i"</em>)<br><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/10mufxe.png" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Now that you are in your folder with your PQR and IN files, using the tab shortkey (as mentioned above), type the first letter of your 
desired IN file. This is very important; apbs does not need the PQR file, it needs the IN file to operate.<br>
Once you find your IN file, hit enter and APBS will run its calculations and save a DX file (File containing electrostatic fields coordinates) in your folder. </p></li>
</ol><p>You are done running APBS!</p>

Fasciculin-1 is an acetylcholinesterase (this compound ends the communication between muscle cells) inhibitor found in the venom of the green mamba. This allows the action potential to go uncurbed which causes small involuntary muscle contractions (it paralyzes the injected subject).</p>

<p>To set up the molecule follow the <strong>"Introduction to PDB2PQR"</strong> instructions above.</p>

<li><p>Next go to the Plugin tab and open APBS Tools... (where ... is a number referring to the  version). In the window that comes up, click "Use another PQR" and then "Choose Externally Generated PQR:".<br><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/14sgjkj.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Now find the file that you created using the webserver and click ok.<br><img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2z84xtj.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Go into "My Computer" and in the upper right corner and type in apbs.exe and press enter (to search for it).<br><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/30nj3wj.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Once you find the file, left click on it once to select it, then right click and go to open file location.<br><img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/14xyukp.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>Click on the white space in the top of window.<br><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2zjls7t.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>When the path is highlighted blue, Right click on it,<br><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2l8kv2e.jpg" alt=""></p></li>
<li><p>And hit Copy (to copy the file path).<br><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2l93528.jpg" alt=""></p></li>

<p><a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?pdbId=1MYK">The needed protein for this VMD tutorial</a> (1MYK a.k.a Hyperstable Arc Repressor Mutant PL8). An arc repressor is a small protein that acts as a transcription factor. This is a mutant that has the Proline-8 (in location 8) replaced by a Leucine. This creates enhanced stability due to an extra hydrogen bond, but also decreases the affinity of the molecule to bind to DNA.</p>

<p>In order to set up the molecule, follow the same instructions as <strong>"Introduction to PDB2PQR"</strong> but replace the shown molecule with 1MYK.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open the downloaded PQR file and go to the bottom where the "HETATMs" are listed. There should be the 3 parts of a water molecule (labeled HOH). Delete these.

<a name="dime-value-problems" class="anchor" href="#dime-value-problems"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DIME VALUE PROBLEMS</h2>

<p>When running APBS, DIME values may become a problem that keeps apbs electrostatic calculations from running. In order to check DIME values, you need to check the .in file for DIME values. One can change the DIME values of an APBS file by going through a text editor and manually changing the dime values. </p>

<p><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/6eepsl.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The picture above shows a sample .in file, which can be obtained after running PDB2PQR on the desired protein. </p>

<p>Dime values are the dimensions for the XYZ grid for the protein. Each  grid point requires about 160B of memory, and to get the total number if grid points the x,y,z grid elements are multiplied. The multi-grid solver iterates over all of these elements to find the electrostatic potential at each of those locations. If the dimensions are too large, the computer will have a memory problem and will be unable to calculate the electrostatic fields, such as:</p>

<p><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2v16loz.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In order to work around this issue, you must manually change the DIME values to a smaller size. For the HIV-1 RT, I changed the DIME values to 129, which allowed APBS to run as normal and calculate a .dx file. </p>

<p>Choosing the appropriate DIME value will fix the memory problems that may occur. The reason problems with DIME values may be too big is when PDB2PQR calculates the input file, it measures DIME values based on the size of the protein. For example,with HIV-1, it is protein with 2 chains of 400+ residues, and so the DIME values are unnecessarily large. </p>

<p>To expand on DIME values, since a computer only knows about 1s and 0s convention is used to encode and decode values to the bits and bytes in memory; this is often called a type system.  An 8 bit byte has eight slots for a bit (1 or 0); therefore, if you are only considering positive numbers, it may hold a value between 0 (00000000) and 2^8 – 1  (11111111) which is 255 (though 2^8 is 256, and we have to subtract one because '0' takes up a slot).</p>

<p>To represent negative numbers, APBS uses the two's compliment encoding. This means if the left-most bit is a 1, then the number is negative, and so we invert the bits (change 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's), add 1, and read the value.  As an example, below is a table that shows the values of  just four bits (a nibble) that are decoded as unsigned and signed (using two's compliment) integers:</p>

<p>0000 = 0  :  0
0001 = 1  :  1
0010 = 2  :  2
0011 = 3  :  3
1101 = 13 : -3
1110 = 14 : -2
1111 = 15 : -1 </p>

<p>The problem is that APBS used a signed integer in the 1.4 release to store the total number of elements.  If the total got bigger than 2^(n-1) - 1, where n is the width of the integer (in our case a 32 bit wide int so 2^(n-1) = 2,147,483,648) then the number "overflowed" and looked like a negative number.  </p>

<p>In the new APBS release, this was fixed by using an unsigned type that is as big as the machine can support, generally a 64 bit number.</p>
